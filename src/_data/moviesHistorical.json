There's a difference in knowing what's happening versus actually feeling the depth of emotion that each character experiences. I can tell that when I rewatch this in 50 years it's going to smash my heart to bits, but right now I'm only 22 and there's no way I can appreciate it fully in the way that other people do."

(they can’t!)\r\n\r\nadding an extra half star because each shot seems so thoughtfully planned and the end result is a very beautiful looking movie.\r\n\r\noh and i liked getting exposition thru a customs officer very cool!"

    "reviewText": "On the eve of my final breath, I found myself ensnared in the tendrils of an uncharted science, where memories became as malleable as taffy, and time whispered its elusive tales. The dimly lit chamber cradled the specters of beloved kin, their gazes serving as portals to an impending adieu.\r\n\r\nClad in antiseptic whites, the scientists unveiled an elixir—the Chronochoc—a seductive promise to iron out life's wrinkles, to unwind the spool of existence. \"December 15, 2023. Transport me to the day Wonka's enchantment first unfolded before my unsuspecting eyes,\" I declared, the syrupy essence of nostalgia lingering on my lips.\r\n\r\nMy daughter, tears cascading like molten chocolate, clutched a relic from our familial trove. \"Dad, you cannot obliterate the imprints of time. What of us? The memories that sculpted our shared narrative.\"\r\n\r\nMy son, his voice quivering like a delicate praline, echoed her sentiments. \"Ponder the milestones, the anecdotes resonating through the labyrinth of time.\"\r\n\r\nYet, the beguiling melody of Wonka's chocolate realm beckoned—a confectionary sonnet weaving through the epochs. \"I must return, unearth the symphony of innocence,\" I insisted, my heart heavy with the burdens of my cocoa-infused resolution.\r\n\r\nMy wife, guardian of memories and connoisseur of patience, clung to a weathered photograph, whispering, \"What if you forfeit us, relinquish the shared murmurs of our love?\"\r\n\r\nIn her gaze, a tempest of sentiments reflected—a turbulent sea of emotions. \"I shall not forget. But in the twilight of my days, I must pursue the echoes of a realm where candy canes stood tall, and oompa loompas danced.\"\r\n\r\nAs the needle, herald of temporal metamorphosis, approached, the room morphed into an amphitheater of unspoken pleas and teary gazes. Murmurs of hesitation lingered like the echos of a forgotten nocturne, punctuated by the reveries steeped in chocolate.\r\n\r\n\"December 15, 2023—the day the veil of Wonka's enchantment first parted,\" I uttered. Yet, as the elixir wove its sorcery through my veins, an idiosyncratic delusion seized me. The fantastical domain of Wonka began to intermingle with the tangible—a fusion of chocolate-drenched hallucinations seeping into my discourse.\r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Cartel hatched schemes in my whimsical cogitations, 500 chocoholic monks chanted in sweet consonance, and giraffes with candy-striped necks roved surreal landscapes. I was served Hoverchocs by the late Baron Vonschmeigelhammer, elevating me into the ethereal, and I soared through clouds of cocoa dust, my utterances metamorphosing into a harmonious blend of sweet delusion and poignant reminiscence.\r\n\r\nMy family, erstwhile patient auditors to my sugary hallucinations, now implored with desperate timbre, \"Father, these illusions bear no substance. Break free from this cacao-induced reverie! The chocolate-swathed giraffes and monks are figments. Recall us, not the mirages that dissolve like toffee in the sun.\" The pleas encircled me like a somber dark chocolate rivulet, as I grappled with the demarcation between the cocoa-coated dreams and the reality they entreated me to reclaim.\r\n\r\nIn the concluding moments, the room resonated with the fading murmurs of temporal alchemy, and a bittersweet melody permeated the air. An Oompa Loompa materialized, its diminutive form swaying to a capricious melody:\r\n\r\n🎶\"Oompa loompa, doompa dee doo,\r\nIn Wonka's realm, there are dreams anew.\r\nBeware the candy's enchanting haze,\r\nWhere reality dissolves in a daze.\r\n\r\nChocolate rivers and towering giraffes,\r\nHoverchocs lift on cocoa wafts.\r\nThe Chocolate Cartel whispers delight,\r\nIn a world where day fades to night.\r\n\r\nYour kin implores, love enduring and true,\r\nTo pierce the chocolate, the dreams undue.\r\nWill you emerge from this sugarfied trance,\r\nOr waltz forever in confectionary dance?\r\n\r\nOompa loompa, doompa dee dee,\r\nReality or fantasy, what shall it be?\r\nThe answer floats in the candy air,\r\nAs you traverse a world beyond compare.\"🎶\r\n\r\nThe Oompa Loompa's serenade reverberated through the dwindling corridors of my awareness, the dulcet notes intermingling with the elixir's enchantment. The destiny of my reawakening lingered, accompanied by the whimsical melody that swirled like a mist of caramelized reverie, leaving the resolution of my chocolaty dreamscape draped in a saccharine shroud."

(although it’s mega mega oscar bait and you can tell cooper is basically begging for it)"
